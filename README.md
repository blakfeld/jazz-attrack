# Jazz AtTrack

My wife and I just had our first child, and like all new parents we're convinced that we need to track every
little thing she does. My wife had an app, but it was cumbersome to share between us. As an engineer, this
seemed like one of the few challenges of parenthood I was well equipped to solve.

I took this as a chance to dive into Typescript and Google's firebase offerings.
